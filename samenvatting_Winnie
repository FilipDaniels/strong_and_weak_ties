What are the points I would like to make?

* We need a new way of organising our work in organisational structures.

* Many attempts have been made to design new ways of organising our work, yet these haven't led to a useful guide to follow and subsequent widespread adaptation

* What is the best way of organising our work? We do not know the answer, and we should become better at searching for an answer if we want to stand a chance. Rather than to focus on an ideal design of a futureproof organisation and the mechanisms of its survival or evolution, we need a framework for experimentation with ifferent organisational forms with a focus on the early stages and the experimentation process itself.

* The new organisation must have at its core the needs of the people in it: these needs will drive the organisation forward and enable competition with classical incumbent organisations. However, the act of productive labour in the existing market is essential to tie the organisation together and secure its survival.
