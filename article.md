#Strong & Weak Ties in Collaborative Organisations (Working title)

##Hypothesis to start from?
Might be good to have hypothesis as a starting point. Possibly: Weak ties make collaborative, emergent organisations stronger fragilizing the network to allow diversity to support further development of the collective.

##A Biological View
Ants are a popular colony to refer to (ref. 'There is one fundamental difference between the way in which ants and termites operate and the way in which we organise ourselves.' - Primavera De Filippi – TEDxCambridge – [From Competition to Cooperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYOPcHRO3tc&feature=youtu.be) (re-watch)

##A Sociological View
Refering to one of the most cited papers in science: The Strength of Weak Ties by Mark Granovetter.

##Adding Networked Media
Lovink and Ned Rossiter talk about the temporal equivalents of strong and weak ties - long and short ties in relation to events such as occupy emerging from dicontent with the status-quo. I believe networked collectives such as Enspiral, Hackistan, EdgeRiders have this urge to stretch the event and build long term transition instead of just lasting an event. Occupy and Enspiral can be linked in historical terms through Loomio. While Loomio lives on with Enspiral, Occupy died but nevertheless was maybe one of the most crucial manifestations to put Enspiral where it is now? In other words one can wonder if Enspiral would have been known to us if Occupy did not happen. Or would it just have taken longer?

In addition we can talk about how the retreat built momentum for Hackistan, the co-working space did not work. Then you also have the new momentum around the civic innovation event. So then it seems to come down to moving on from event to event. Lovink and Rossiter seem to suggest otherwise. On the other hand the retreat brought another group together than the initial group so maybe this forking was needed to come to the Civic Tech project and move on.

Just a small first snippet from Lovink and Rossiter: 'Networks are not goals in themselves and are made subordinate to the organisational purpose. Internet and smart-phone based communication was once new and exciting. This caused some distraction but that’s soon going to be over. Distraction itself is becoming boring. The positive side of networks – in comparison to the group – remains its open architecture. However, what networks need to ‘learn’ is how to split-off or ‘fork’ once they start getting too big. At this point networks typically enter the danger-zone of losing focus. Intelligent software can assist us to dissolve connections, close conversations and delete groups once their task is over. We should never be afraid to end the party.' [source](http://theoccupiedtimes.org/?p=12358)
